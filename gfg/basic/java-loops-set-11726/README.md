## Problem

For a given N, return an arraylist containing the sum of even and odd integers of the first N natural numbers.

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input:
N = 1
Output:
0 1
Explanation:
Natural numbers less than 1 are only 1.
So the sum of even number = 0.
and the sum of odd number = 1.
```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input:
N = 6
Output:
12 9  
Explanation:
Natural numbers less than 6 are 
1 2 3 4 5 6
So the sum of even number = 2 + 4 + 6 = 12.
and the sum of odd number = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9.
```

 **Your Task:**  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function  **getSum** () which takes an integer N as input parameter and return an arraylist containing the sum of even and odd natural number less than equal to N.

 **Expected Time Complexity:**  O(N)
 **Expected Auxiliary Space** : O(1)

 **Constraints:** 
1<= N <=104

```java
class Solution {
    static ArrayList<Integer> getSum(int N) {
        // code here
        ArrayList<Integer> a= new ArrayList<>();
        int e=0;
        int o=0;
        for(int i=1;i<=N;i++){
            if(i%2==0){
                e+=i;
            }else{
                o+=i;
            }
           
            
        }
         a.add(e);
        a.add(o);
        return a;
    }
}
```
